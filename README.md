Another One Bytes The Dust

Currently we have our MrRoboto code up on the repository. 
This bot is an exact copy of the Trout Bot.

We plan on adding these potential changes:
1. Making it so after the king the bot priorotizes taking the queen
2. Making a power hungry bot that only cares about taking pieces, so if it sees a piece and can take it it will

Problems we have run into:
1. The function to sense the king is only applicable to the king piece
